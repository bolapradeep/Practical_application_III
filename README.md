##7 Practial Application III : Comparing Classifiers

### Overview

In this practical application assignment, the goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines). The dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone. Which helps in predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features such as age, job, previous marketing outcomes, and economic indicators. The dataset from a Portuguese banking institution, can be found at [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)

### Understanding Data

For analyzing and modeling, features such as age, job, marital status, education, default status, balance, and more are used to predict the target variable (whether the client subscribed to a term deposit).

### Understand the Business
- The business goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on the results of telemarketing campaigns.
- This prediction will help the bank target potential customers more effectively, optimizing marketing strategies and improving conversion rates.

### Data preparation
Visualizations are used to understand the features and their relationships
The dataset is split into training and test sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test) to evaluate model performance.

### Modeling with Different Classifiers
-Logistic Regression
-Decision Trees
-Support Vector Machines (SVM)
-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Each classifier is trained on the training data, and the performance is evaluated on the test set.

#### Predictive Power of Features
The analysis revealed that certain features are particularly influential in predicting term deposit subscriptions:
- Previous Campaign Outcome: The outcome of previous marketing campaigns (poutcome) is one of the strongest predictors.
- Economic Indicators: Variables like the euribor 3-month rate and employment variation rate also play a critical role in influencing subscription decisions.
- Pdays: Whether a client was contacted in a previous campaign (and how recently) significantly affects the likelihood of a successful subscription.

### Model Performance
-Logistic Regression provided a balanced approach, showing strong performance with interpretable coefficients.
-Decision Trees were effective but prone to overfitting, especially on the training data, suggesting the need for more regularization.
-SVM (Support Vector Machine) showed robust performance but at the cost of higher computational resources.
-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) also performed well but was less interpretable compared to Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

### Next Steps and Recommendations
- Model Improvement: Notyable Suggestions for hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy and ROC AUC scores.
- Feature Engineering: Explored additional feature engineering to further improve model performance.
- Business Application: Recommended for deploying the selected model into a production environment, with regular monitoring and retraining to maintain performance.
- Further Analysis: Investigated the impact of additional features or external data sources on model performance to enhance predictions.
